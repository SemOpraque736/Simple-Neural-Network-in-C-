# Simple-Neural-Network-in-C#-
Its my first time making a Code in C#. Its not that good, but im tried.
Im started learning C# a two days ago, and this code will be very simple. This code only have for, console, operations math and variables.

# Whats the Code do?
Its make a neural network in a simple traning, with a random data and weithgs.
its have epochs and a simple (1, 8, 1) Neural Mlp.

# What in days You make this code? And how you make.
hmmm, like 2 days. Its have had much errors for my first time.
Im use VS code, because im standing in windows for while.

Its was cool making this code because, the code is simples and interisting.
im will make uptades, likes putting a gui or a better objective for the neural network.
